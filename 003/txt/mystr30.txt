¡°Not for long,¡± said Hermione in a satisfied tone. ¡°The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now.¡±

At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.

Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.

¡°Wake up,¡± she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.

¡°Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -¡± said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.

¡°Merry Christmas to you, too,¡± said Hermione, throwing him his present. ¡°I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It's ready.¡±

Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.

¡°Are you sure?¡±

¡°Positive,¡± said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. ¡°If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.¡±

At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.

¡°Hello,¡± said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. ¡°Are you speaking to me again?¡±

She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.

The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxurious eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.

No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.

The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read ¡°Pinhead,¡± kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remark about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours'time.

Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.

¡°We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,¡± said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. ¡°And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him.

¡°I've got it all worked out,¡± she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. ¡°I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.¡±

Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.

¡°Hermione, I don't think¡ª¡±

¡°That could go seriously wrong¡ª¡±

But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.

¡°The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,¡± she said sternly. ¡°You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?¡±

¡°Oh, all right, all right,¡± said Harry. ¡°But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?¡±

¡°I've already got mine!¡± said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. ¡°Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.¡±

When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.

¡°Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?¡±

But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.

¡°How thick can you get?¡± Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.

By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.

They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.

¡°Hermione?¡±

They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.

¡°Did you get them?¡± Hermione asked breathlessly.

Harry showed her Goyle's hair.

¡°Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,¡± Hermione said, holding up a small sack. ¡°You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.¡±

The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.

¡°I'm sure I've done everything right,¡± said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. ¡°It looks like the book says it should¡­ once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.¡±

¡°Now what?¡± Ron whispered.

¡°We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.¡±

Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass.

The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.

¡°Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,¡± said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. ¡°Bet it tastes disgusting.¡±

¡°Add yours, then,¡± said Hermione.

Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.

¡°Hang on,¡± said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. ¡°We'd better not all drink them in here¡­ Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.¡±

¡°Good thinking,¡± said Ron, unlocking the door. ¡°We'll take separate stalls.¡±

Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.

¡°Ready?¡± he called.

¡°Ready,¡± came Ron's and Hermione's voices.

¡°One - two - three¡ª¡±

Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.

Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts - his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small.

As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, ¡°Are you two okay?¡± Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.
