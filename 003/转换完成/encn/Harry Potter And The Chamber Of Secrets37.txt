something thrashing wildly off the pillars.
他忍不住了-他睁开眼睛，斜视着什么
He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what

巨大的毒蛇，明亮，有毒的绿色，厚如橡木的树干，
The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,
在空中高高举起，它的钝顶正在编织
had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving
醉在支柱之间。

当哈利颤抖时，准备关闭他的

眼睛转过头，他看到了使蛇分心的东西。

福克斯（Fawkes）的脑袋高高飞扬，而蛇怪则响着
Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping
像一把军刀一样细细的毒牙对他怒不可遏。
furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers.
福克斯俯冲而下。
Fawkes dived.
他长长的金色喙沉没在视线中，
His long golden beak sank out of sight and a
黑血的骤然洒落在地板上。
sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor.
蛇的尾巴
The snake's tail
跳了起来，险些想念哈利，在哈利无法关门之前

眼睛转过身-哈利直视着它的脸，看到它

“没有！”
NO!
哈利听到里德尔尖叫。 
Harry heard Riddle screaming.
“离开伯德！离开
LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE
鸟！
THE BIRD!
男孩在你身后。
THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.
你还是可以的
YOU CAN STILL SMELL
他。

杀了他！”
KILL HIM!
瞎眼的蛇摇曳，迷惑，仍然致命。
The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly.
福克斯原为

“救救我，救救我，”哈利疯狂地说，“有人-任何人！
Help me, help me, Harry muttered wildly, someone - anyone!
蛇的尾巴再次在地板上鞭打。
The snake's tail whipped across the floor again.
哈里躲开了。
Harry ducked.
他的脸上有些软。
Something soft hit his face.
蛇怪把分拣帽扫到了哈利的怀里。
The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms.
哈利

那是他剩下的，唯一的机会-他把它撞到了他的身上

“救救我-救救我-”哈利想，眼睛在帽子下拧紧了。
Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.
“请帮我！”
Please help me!
没有回音。
There was no answering voice.
相反，帽子收缩了，好像
Instead, the hat contracted, as though
一只看不见的手紧紧地挤压着它。
an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.
哈利的头顶上满是沉重的东西，
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head,
差点把他淘汰

星星在眼前眨动，他抓住了
Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed
帽子的顶部将其拉下，感觉有些长而硬

帽子内部出现了一条闪闪发光的银色剑，其手柄

闪闪发光的红宝石蛋大小。
glittering with rubies the size of eggs.
“杀死男孩！离开伯德！男孩在你身后。
KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.
嗅探器-聪明的他。”
SNIFF - SMELL HIM.
哈利站起来，准备好了。
Harry was on his feet, ready.
蛇怪的头跌落，身体
The basilisk's head was falling, its body
盘绕着，扭曲着面对他，撞到了柱子。
coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him.
他可以看到
He could see the
巨大，血腥的眼窝，看到嘴巴张开，足够宽

吞噬他整个身体，排成一排的fang牙，只要他的剑稀薄，

闪闪发光，有毒...

它盲目地扑了过去。
It lunged blindly.
哈利躲开了，撞到了房间的墙上。
Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall.
扑了过去
It lunged
再次，它的分叉的舌头猛击了哈利的身边。
again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side.
他举起剑
He raised the sword
在他的手中。
in both his hands.
蛇怪再次隆起，这次的目标是真实的-哈利扔了
The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw
他的全部重量都落在了剑后面，并将其推到屋顶
his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof
蛇的嘴。

但是随着温暖的血液浸湿了哈利的手臂，他感到了灼痛
But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just
肘部上方

一个长而毒的毒牙正在下沉，

深深地刺入他的手臂，蛇怪在龙骨上盘旋了

哈利从墙上滑下来。

即使他放下毒牙，看着自己的鲜血

soaking his robes, his vision went foggy.
分庭正在解散
The Chamber was dissolving
暗淡的颜色。
in a whirl of dull color.
一片猩红色的游动过去，哈利听到一阵柔和的爪声
A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws
在他旁边。

“福克斯，”哈利厚重地说。 
Fawkes, said Harry thickly.
“你真棒，福克斯……”
You were fantastic, Fawkes ...
他觉得那只鸟在蛇的头上站了漂亮的头。
He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's
fang已经刺穿了他。
fang had pierced him.
他听见回荡的脚步声，然后有黑影移进来
He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in
在他的前面。

“你已经死了，哈利·波特，”里德尔在他上方的声音说。 
You're dead, Harry Potter, said Riddle's voice above him.
“死。
Dead.
甚至邓布利多的鸟也知道。
Even Dumbledore's bird knows it.
波特，你知道他在做什么吗？
Do you see what he's doing, Potter?
他在哭。”
He's crying.
哈利眨眨眼。
Harry blinked.
福克斯的头滑入和移出焦点。
Fawkes's head slid in and out of focus.
浓密的珍珠泪

“我要坐在这里看着你死，哈利·波特。慢慢来。
I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.
我不着急。”
I'm in no hurry.
哈利昏昏欲睡。
Harry felt drowsy.
他周围的一切似乎都在旋转。
Everything around him seemed to be spinning.
“就这样结束了著名的哈利·波特，”里德尔遥远的声音说。 
So ends the famous Harry Potter, said Riddle's distant voice.
“单独

But was this dying?
分庭似乎没有变黑，而是

“滚开，鸟。”里德尔的声音突然说道。 
Get away, bird, said Riddle's voice suddenly.
“离开他-
Get away from him -
我说，走开！”
I said, get away!
哈利抬起头。
Harry raised his head.
里德尔指着哈利的魔杖

像枪一样的爆炸声，福克斯又乘飞机
there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a

He raised the wand.
然后，一阵翅膀，福克斯飞回头顶，
Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and
日记掉进了哈利的腿。
something fell into Harry's lap - the diary.
瞬间，魔杖的哈利和里德尔都抬起头，凝视着它。
For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.
然后，没有思考，没有考虑，好像他打算
Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to
一直做，哈利抓住了他旁边地板上的蛇怪牙。

哈利的魔杖拍打声落在地板上，在那里
