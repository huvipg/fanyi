弗农·达斯利先生已被唤醒
Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in
清晨时分
the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his
侄子哈利的房间。
nephew Harry's room.
“这星期第三次！”
Third time this week!
他在桌子上咆哮。 
he roared across the table.
“如果你做不到
If you can't
控制那只猫头鹰，它必须走！”
control that owl, it'll have to go!
哈利再次尝试解释。
Harry tried, yet again, to explain.
“她很无聊，”他说。 
She's bored, he said.
“她曾经在外面飞来飞去。如果可以的话
She's used to flying around outside. If I could
晚上让她出去-”
just let her out at night -
“我看起来很蠢吗？”
Do I look stupid?
弗农大叔咆哮，有些煎蛋晃来晃去

从他浓密的胡子。 
from his bushy mustache.
“我知道那只猫头鹰放开会怎样
I know what'll happen if that owl's let
出来。”

他与妻子矮牵牛交换了黑暗的表情。
He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.
哈利试图反驳，但他的话被很长一段时间淹没了，
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,
Dursleys的儿子Dudley大声叫。
loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley.
“我想要更多的培根。”
I want more bacon.
“煎锅里还有更多甜食，”佩妮尤妮姨妈说，
There's more in the frying pan, sweetums, said Aunt Petunia,
看着她大儿子的雾蒙蒙的眼睛。 
turning misty eyes on her massive son.
“我们必须在建立你的同时
We must build you up while
我们有机会...我不喜欢学校食物的声音
we've got the chance ... I don't like the sound of that school food
...”
...
“胡说八道，佩妮，当我在冶炼厂时，我从不饿。”
Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,
弗农叔叔发自内心地说道。 
said Uncle Vernon heartily.
“达德利够了，不是吗，儿子？”
Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?
达德利（Dudley）身材魁梧，他的屁股下垂在两侧
Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
厨房椅子，笑了，转向哈利。
kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.
“通过煎锅。”
Pass the frying pan.
“你忘记了魔语，”哈利烦躁地说。
You've forgotten the magic word, said Harry irritably.
这个简单的句子对整个家庭的影响是
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
不可思议：达德利倒吸了一口气，从椅子上摔下来，
incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that
震撼了整个厨房；
shook the whole kitchen;
德思礼太太尖叫了一声，
Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and
她的手拍到嘴里；
clapped her hands to her mouth;
德思礼先生跳了起来，
Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,
血管在他的太阳穴中th动。
veins throbbing in his temples.
“我的意思是“请”！
I meant please!
哈利很快说。 
said Harry quickly.
“我不是那个意思-”
I didn't mean -
“我告诉你的是什么，”他的叔叔喷口吐口水。
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU, thundered his uncle, spraying spit
在桌子上，“关于我们说“ M”字

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
试图让达德利站起来。
trying to heave Dudley to his feet.
“好吧，”哈利说，“好吧……”
All right, said Harry, all right... 
弗农叔叔坐下，呼吸得像缠绕的犀牛，
Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
看着哈利从他那双细小而锐利的眼睛的角落里走出来。
watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.
自从哈利放暑假回家以来，叔叔
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle
弗农一直像对待炸弹一样对待他，随时可能爆炸

哈利·波特（Harry Potter）是一名巫师-他在大一的第一年就崭新了
Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at
霍格华兹魔法与巫术学院。

达斯利一家被巫师称为麻瓜
The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles
（不是一滴神奇的血液在他们的血管中），
(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
就他们而言，在家里有一个巫师是

一岁的时候，哈利以某种方式幸免于难

那时，弗农叔叔重要地清了清嗓子，说：
At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,
“现在，众所周知，今天是非常重要的一天。”
Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.
哈利抬起头，几乎不敢相信。
Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.
“这很可能是我职业生涯中最重要的一天，”
This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, 
弗农大叔说。
said Uncle Vernon.
哈利回去敬酒。
Harry went back to his toast.
当然，他对弗农叔叔哈里·波特（Harry Potter）和密室（The Chamber of Secrets.txt）怀有痛苦的想法。
