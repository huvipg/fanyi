然后，他将臭袜子塞入了卢修斯·马尔福的手中。

“什么-？”

马尔福先生把袜子从日记上撕下来，扔到一边，然后看了看。

“你让我失去了我的仆人，男孩！”

但是多比大喊：“你不要伤害哈利·波特！”

“哈利·波特释放多比！”
Harry Potter freed Dobby!
小精灵刺耳的说，凝视着哈利，

“哈利·波特让多比免费！”

“至少我能做，多比。”哈利咧嘴一笑。

“只许永远

多比抱住哈利的中部，抱住他。
Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him.
“哈利·波特远远超过多比所知道的！”
Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!
他抽泣。
