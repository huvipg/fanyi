多比的警告

哈利设法不大喊大叫，但这是一件近距离的事。
Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing.
小一点

当他们凝视彼此时，哈利从大厅听到了达德利的声音。
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall.
“梅森先生和太太，我可以拿你的外套吗？”
May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?
这个生物从床上滑下来，弯下腰，以至于它的末端

“真的吗？”

哈利说。 
said Harry.

你在这里有什么特别的原因吗？”
is there any particular reason you're here?
“哦，是的，先生。”多比认真地说道。 
Oh, yes, sir, said Dobby earnestly.
“多比来告诉你，
Dobby has come to tell you,
先生...这很困难，先生...多比想知道从哪里开始...”
sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin ...
“坐下。”哈利客气地指着床。
Sit down, said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.
令他惊恐的是，小精灵哭了起来-非常吵的眼泪。
To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.
“坐下！”
S-sit down!
他哭了。 
he wailed.
“永远……永远……”
Never ... never ever ... 
哈利以为他听到楼下的声音步履蹒跚。
Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.
“我很抱歉，”他小声说道，“我不是要冒犯您或其他任何东西。”
I'm sorry, he whispered, I didn't mean to offend you or anything.
“冒犯多比！”

多比免费。多比将为家人服务，直到他去世，先生...”

哈利凝视着。
Harry stared.
“而且我以为我在这里再呆四个星期很不好，”

他说。 
he said.
“这使Dursleys听起来几乎像人一样。没有人能

哈利几乎立刻希望他不讲话。

that's Hermione, she -
但是他很快停了下来，因为考虑赫敏是痛苦的。
But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.
“哈利·波特谦虚谦虚，”多比虔诚地说道，他的宝珠-

像眼睛在闪烁。

他又停了下来。
He stopped again.
考虑罗恩也很痛苦。
Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
多比向哈利倾斜，他的眼睛像前灯一样睁大。
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“多比听见了，”他嘶哑地说，“哈利·波特遇到了黑暗

哈利点点头，多比的眼泪突然闪着泪。

多比慢慢地摇了摇头。

But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give
哈利一个提示。
Harry a hint.
但是，哈利完全迷路了。
Harry, however, was completely lost.
“他没有兄弟，对吗？”
He hasn't got a brother, has he?
多比摇了摇头，他的眼睛比以往任何时候都宽。
Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.

“甚至不写信给哈利·波特的朋友？”

多比狡猾地说。

“我希望他们来过-等一下，”哈利皱着眉头说。
I expect they've just been - wait a minute, said Harry, frowning.
“你怎么知道我的朋友没有写信给我？”
How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
多比打着他的脚。
Dobby shuffled his feet.
“哈利·波特一定不要对多比生气。多比做到了最好……”
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best ...
“你一直在阻止我的来信吗？”
