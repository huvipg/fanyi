Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand.
洛克哈特滑了双腿

“我真的不认为-”他开始说，但罗恩推了他一下，

他滑了出来。

哈利迅速跟进。
Harry followed quickly.
他降低了自己
He lowered himself
慢慢地进入管道，然后放开。

这就像冲下无尽的，黏糊糊的，黑暗的幻灯片。
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide.

在他的身后，他可以听到罗恩，在弯道上微微拍打。

他们三个都转身凝视着前方的黑暗。
All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.
“ Lumos！”

哈利咕w着魔杖，然后又亮了起来。 
Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again.
“来吧，”他

隧道太黑了，他们只能看见前方一小段距离。
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.
他们在潮湿的墙壁上的影子在烛光下显得异常可怕。
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.
“记住，”当他们谨慎地向前走时，哈利轻声说，
Remember, Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,
“任何动静的迹象，请立即闭上眼睛……”

但是隧道像坟墓一样安静，还有第一个意外的声音

哈利只能看到事物的轮廓

它没有动。
It wasn't moving.
“也许是睡着了。”他呼吸，回头看向另外两个。
Maybe it's asleep, he breathed, glancing back at the other two.
洛克哈特的手压在他的眼睛上。
Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes.
哈利转过身来
Harry turned back to

“站起来，”罗恩尖锐地说道，将魔杖指向洛克哈特。

他喊道。

“你还好吗？罗恩！”

罗恩从落石后面传来低沉的声音。

哈利抬头看着隧道的天花板。

里面出现了巨大的裂缝。

然后他独自一人越过那条巨大的蛇皮。
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.
不久，罗恩拉扯着移动岩石的遥远的声音消失了。
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.
隧道转弯又转弯。
The tunnel turned and turned again.
哈利身上的每条神经

他可以猜测自己该做什么。

“打开。”哈利低沉的嘶嘶声说道。
